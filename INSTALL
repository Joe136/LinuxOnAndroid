Install
=======

There are multiple ways to install the scripts

Simplest way:                                                                   
Create a folder on the sdcard and move your linux image into this folder.

Example:
$EXTERNAL_STORAGE/linux/linux.img   # This is the image
sh $ESTERNAL_STORAGE/linux/install.sh   # Install the scripts & mount the image
linux   # Start Linux


More Complex:
Same like in simple but folder name and image name could be different.

$EXTERNAL_STORAGE/imagepath/image.img   # This is the image
sh $ESTERNAL_STORAGE/imagepath/install.sh image   # Install the scripts & mount the image
image   # Start Linux


With config file (most flexible):
$EXTERNAL_STORAGE/imagepath/image.img   # This is the image
sh $ESTERNAL_STORAGE/imagepath/install.sh linux   # Install the scripts, currently it will break
nano $ANDROID_DATA/local/linuxonandroid/config.linux   # Modificate the config file
    img="$sdcard/imagepath/linux.img"
sh $ESTERNAL_STORAGE/imagepath/install.sh image   # Reinstall the scripts & mount the image, now it will work
linux   # Start Linux
