IMPORTANT:
mksh does not use BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV (install.sh) | test current solution | seems it works, but 'mksh install.sh linux' registers the first/last argument two times


REST:
rebuild scripts/linux to use functions (e.g. for main mount) instead of switch with loop | began | moved all parts into functions
speedup bashrc, it's really slow, test it first | bash_completition is slow | began with auto-creating reduced versions of bashrc/bash_aliases
design a method to trigger the installation of rootfs with config file
write program to read config file for installing rootfs parts


UNIMPORTANT:
